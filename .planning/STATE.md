## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Web app over Google Sheets: Need role-based views, SellerCloud integration, and clean UX
- Start with Excel import, add API later: SellerCloud API access not yet available; team needs visibility now
- Cash flow visibility deferred: Focus on demand and order tracking first; CFW features moved to next session

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 considerations:**
- SellerCloud API credentials pending from VPS setup
- Google Sheets master product data needs export for initial master data load
- Data quality in existing Excel files not yet audited (research flags 90% of spreadsheets contain errors)

**Change management:**
- Non-technical team requires intuitive UI design from day one
- Parallel Excel usage needed during transition period
- Internal champion should be identified for adoption advocacy
